# AMLS_II_assignment20_21
Research project for AMLS II (ELEC0135)


The project script details the parameters for training the agent and for testing it against the semi-random opponent:

Just for fun, I have included this code the user would like to play either the semi-random opponent or the trained agent:
https://github.com/uceerbr/AMLS_II_assignment20_21/blob/main/connect4_PlayTheAgent.ipynb

Either piece of code requires access to the DQN model in the directory ./Trainings_500Ktraining/models4/dqn_training_reducedLossPenalty


I ran the program in an environment that had these libraries installed:

Libraries.yaml
